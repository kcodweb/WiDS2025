# WiDS2025 Predicting Stock Volatility Using Financial News Sentiment Analysis

## Description
This project explores how financial news sentiment influences stock market volatility, combining fundamental concepts from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Quantitative Financial Analytics.

Participants will collect financial news headlines from XML/RSS feeds (such as Yahoo Finance or Reuters) and merge them with historical stock price data from APIs like yfinance. The workflow includes XML data parsing, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis using models such as VADER or FinBERT, and correlation of sentiment patterns with market movements.

After generating sentiment features, learners will build and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict next-day price direction or volatility levels. The emphasis will be on data understanding, feature engineering, and model interpretation, helping learners connect textual market signals with quantitative outcomes.

The project concludes with a comprehensive analytical notebook and report, including visualizations of sentiment trends and their relation to stock behavior.
An optional extension allows interested participants to create a simple Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.
